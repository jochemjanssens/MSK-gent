Het futurisme leidde hem, zoals zijn vrienden Paul Joostens, Jos Léonard en Jozef Peeters, naar de abstracte kunst. Ook die weg zou De Troyer al snel verlaten voor een verhalend en naïef aandoend expressionisme, dat stilistisch meer aansluiting vindt bij de toenmalige Duitse en Nederlandse Nieuwe Zakelijkheid dan bij het werk van Permeke of De Smet. Met de vogelen uit 1928 is daarvan een goed voorbeeld.

Zoals vele andere kunstenaars was hij geboeid door de ontwikkelingen in de Franse kunst. Zijn meest voldragen werken ontstonden in de volgende jaren, zoals dit portret van zijn vriend, de Spaanse schilder Francisco Iturrino. De monumentale, sombere figuur, gehuld in een wijde cape, is op natuurlijke grootte voorgesteld op de Place Blanche. Het bovenste gedeelte van zijn lichaam tekent zich af tegen een geanimeerde achtergrond, waarin de Moulin Rouge in fel rood de aandacht trekt. De kleurenharmonie, de vastberaden stijl, de soberheid en de gedurfde mise-en-scène, die de figuur afscheidt van de massa, verlenen aan de voorgestelde man een grootse voornaamheid. In het atelier genomen foto’s bewijzen dat de figuur eerder werd geschilderd dan de achtergrond. Dit schilderij is het enige dat Evenepoel tijdens zijn leven aan een museum verkocht heeft.

Het futurisme leidde hem, zoals zijn vrienden Paul Joostens, Jos Léonard en Jozef Peeters, naar de abstracte kunst. Ook die weg zou De Troyer al snel verlaten voor een verhalend en naïef aandoend expressionisme, dat stilistisch meer aansluiting vindt bij de toenmalige Duitse en Nederlandse Nieuwe Zakelijkheid dan bij het werk van Permeke of De Smet. Met de vogelen uit 1928 is daarvan een goed voorbeeld.

De monumentale, sombere figuur, gehuld in een wijde cape, is op natuurlijke grootte voorgesteld op de Place Blanche. Het bovenste gedeelte van zijn lichaam tekent zich af tegen een geanimeerde achtergrond, waarin de Moulin Rouge in fel rood de aandacht trekt. De kleurenharmonie, de vastberaden stijl, de soberheid en de gedurfde mise-en-scène, die de figuur afscheidt van de massa, verlenen aan de voorgestelde man een grootse voornaamheid. In het atelier genomen foto’s bewijzen dat de figuur eerder werd geschilderd dan de achtergrond. Dit schilderij is het enige dat Evenepoel tijdens zijn leven aan een museum verkocht heeft. Het werd verworven ter gelegenheid van het Gentse Salon van 1899.\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n];\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/assets/data/tourData.json\n// module id = 243\n// module chunks = 0"],"sourceRoot":""}
